# yolo

The YOLOv3 object detection algorithm is based on [Joseph Redmon’s famous paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf), while a lot of the code and structure here is based on [Ayoosh Kathuria’s YOLOv3 blog series](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/). YOLO config files and weights are again from [Joseph Redmon](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) himself.
